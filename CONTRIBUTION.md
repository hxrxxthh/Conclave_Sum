TOM - After collaborating on a list of router views and components my INTENTION was to produce a component heirarchy diagram to aid planning and production.

TOM - OUTCOME - I generated a component heirarchy for the main 'chatfeed' page. Feeling some confusion over router pages and their relationship with components - I did some revision then produced a diagram of router pages for the project which showed their relationships and url assignments. INTENTION - To revise Github, then build the router background elements for the group project. And to build the wait animation (loading) component too. 

Joe - studied vue, attended meeting with discussion around hierachy and next steps. Tested the repository system. Build design of avatar component.

6/4 TOM - OUTCOME - Got the router pages code done, and familiarised myself with the Github process by building and merging the wait animation component while sharing with Joe who was also building a component.
