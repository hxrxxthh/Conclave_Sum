TOM - After collaborating on a list of router views and components my INTENTION was to produce a component heirarchy diagram to aid planning and production.

TOM - OUTCOME - I generated a component heirarchy for the main 'chatfeed' page. Feeling some confusion over router pages and their relationship with components - I did some revision then produced a diagram of router pages for the project which showed their relationships and url assignments. INTENTION - To revise Github, then build the router background elements for the group project. And to build the wait animation (loading) component too.

studied git and vue. Starting building components and data structures locally to transfer into project once router and file structures are in place.

6/4 TOM - OUTCOME - Got the router pages code done, and familiarised myself with the Github process by building and merging the wait animation component while sharing with Joe who was also building a component.
